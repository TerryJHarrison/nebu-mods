	Adds early-game trade opportunities to all scenarios. Prevents the need for a trade rush. 
	New cities have weak armies and no walls on warfare missions, allowing for early military conquests instead.

	Warning: Best enabled/disabled before starting new maps - it will reset all city trade relations when loading an existing save after enabling/disabling.

	Source code can be found on [url=https://github.com/TerryJHarrison/nebu-mods/tree/main/mods/expanded_trade_early]GitHub[/url]
