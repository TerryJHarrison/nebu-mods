	Gives stone roads a little beauty appeal, versus the base game where they are treated the same as dirt roads.

	Not enough beauty appeal for peasant houses to reach their max level without other decor.
	See [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2825588196]Appealing Stone Roads[/url] for a version with more beauty appeal.

	Source code can be found on [url=https://github.com/TerryJHarrison/nebu-mods/tree/main/mods/less_appealing_stone_roads]GitHub[/url]
