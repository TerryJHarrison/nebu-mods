	Gives stone roads one square's reach of beauty appeal, versus the base game where they provide no appeal.

	Not enough beauty appeal for peasant houses to be upgraded without other decor.
	See [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2825588196]Appealing Stone Roads[/url] for a version with more beauty appeal.

	Source code can be found on [url=https://github.com/TerryJHarrison/nebu-mods/tree/main/mods/less_appealing_stone_roads]GitHub[/url]
