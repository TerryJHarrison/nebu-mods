	Increases the power of the gods, making them impossible to ignore.

	The lower two worship levels of each god will incur heavy negative penalties, while the higher two worship levels will give stronger buffs. A patron deity scorned will incur an even heavier negative penalty. Shrines will give stronger local buffs.
