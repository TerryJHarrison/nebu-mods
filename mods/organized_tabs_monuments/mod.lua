	Splits monuments into three tabs organized by monument type.

	Compatible (and most useful) with the All Monuments mod - https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2814291990.

	Warning: This mod is incompatible with existing saves that have already built a monument - you will get an error upon trying to load the saved game.
	Your saved game is safe, just disable the mod to play it again.
