	Gives stone roads some beauty appeal, versus the base game where they are treated the same as dirt roads.

	Enough beauty for peasant houses to reach their max level, not enough for townsfolk without other decor.
	See [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2832866413]Less Appealing Stone Roads[/url] for a version with less beauty appeal.
