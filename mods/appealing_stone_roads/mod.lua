	Gives stone roads two square's reach of beauty appeal, versus the base game where they provide no appeal.

	Adds enough beauty for peasant houses to be upgraded, but not enough for villas or residences to upgrade without other decor.
	See [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2832866413]Less Appealing Stone Roads[/url] for a version with less beauty appeal.
